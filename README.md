# Ames Housing Dataset

This repository contains the code and analysis for my project on the Ames Housing Dataset.  
In this project, I explored the Ames Housing Dataset, which contains various features describing residential homes in Ames, Iowa, USA. The main objective was to predict the sale prices of houses based on different attributes such as size, location, and amenities.
